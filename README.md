## 🎓 Motivation Behind Developing This Application  

As students, we often face challenges in managing academics effectively — from keeping track of timetables to maintaining attendance, notes, and events. Most of the time, information gets scattered across different platforms, making it hard to organize and access when needed.  

**StuBuddy** solves this problem by providing all essential student management tools in one place, helping students stay organized and stress-free.

## ❓ Why StuBuddy?

- Timetable & Attendance Management  
- Attendance Analytics (graphs, trends, best day, etc.)  
- Calendar & Event Tracking

StuBuddy provides these services for **free** and is designed purely for student productivity.
